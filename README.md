## FullStack App  GroupThought

Created a full stack application to engage in thoughtful discussion, understand different perspectives and help with collaborative decision-making. Users will be able to create accounts by signing up using their email. Users will be able to post discussion posts that contain a brief title describing your thesis. Users will be able to engage in these discussions by  provide arguments that support or donâ€™t support the topic at hand.
